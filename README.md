# WeatherAndroidKotlinApp
Weather Forecast Next Generation native Android Kotlin Demo App

Only to demo part of my knowledge, really simple project, without MVVM, using Retrofit, okhttp, Moshi, Tabs, ViewPager2, Material3, Kotlin Coil to load images, coroutines, list filtering and sorting, and more.

All written by me to simply demo my knowledge.

*Images are not loaded automatically in the list, only once the user manually downloaded them in the detail view they get cached and can then be shown in the list.
